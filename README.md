Description: 

I started creating this website because of my personal interactions with social media. I realized that I used up so much time on apps like Instagram and Snapchat in college to the point where I decided to delete them to see if I become happier, and I did, for the most part. I think there is a huge benefit to social media as it lets me connect with people everywhere and make sure that I stay in touch with those that I love around the world, back home, and in New York City. I definitely believe in the power of social media to positively effect the world. 

However, I also believe that poeple spend too much time on social media to the point that they are no longer connection, but they are rather destroying their time by doom scrolling and ruining any chance that they have to a happy life. There are a lot of articles on the affect that mobile devices have on happiness and I believe that spending too much tiem on social media causes these effects. So therefore, I decided to create an app that helps. It combines things that I love: Music, CS, and a social website. 

This is only the beginning of my project and I plan on continuing it, as I am taking UI and have taken a class on Mobile App Development as well.
